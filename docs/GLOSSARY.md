# Universe-E Glossary

This glossary defines canonical terms for Universe-E. Each term includes a short definition, non-goals, and one simple example.

## Universe (in Universe-E context)
**Definition:** The bounded operational context in which LPT signals, significance, and energy activation rules are evaluated. It is the conceptual and system boundary for Universe-E.

**Non-goals:**
- Not a physical universe or cosmological model.
- Not a hardware platform or device class.

**Example:** A specific LPT-enabled network of devices where energy activation rules are applied.

## Meaningful Transition
**Definition:** A state change identified by LPT that carries semantic significance for energy activation decisions.

**Non-goals:**
- Not every state change or event.
- Not a prediction or inference model.

**Example:** A verified LPT transition indicating a device moved from idle to active usage.

## Significance Trigger
**Definition:** The threshold or rule that elevates a transition to “meaningful” for the purposes of energy activation.

**Non-goals:**
- Not a human value judgment.
- Not an AI-generated assessment.

**Example:** LPT reports a transition tagged with significance level ≥ S1, which triggers energy activation.

## Sleep (Dormant State)
**Definition:** The default energy-inactive posture of a system or component when no meaningful transitions are present.

**Non-goals:**
- Not deep power-off or physical disconnection.
- Not a performance state optimization.

**Example:** A node remains dormant until an LPT meaningful transition is received.

## Wake (Energy Activation)
**Definition:** The controlled enabling of energy delivery in response to a meaningful transition.

**Non-goals:**
- Not continuous operation.
- Not manual user activation.

**Example:** After a meaningful transition, energy is activated to power a specific subsystem.

## Energy Policy
**Definition:** The rule set describing how Universe-E responds to meaningful transitions with energy activation or continued dormancy.

**Non-goals:**
- Not hardware control firmware.
- Not an optimization algorithm.

**Example:** “If meaningful transition T occurs, activate energy for subsystem A for duration D.”

## Energy-as-a-Protocol
**Definition:** A protocol-driven approach where energy delivery is contingent on semantic transitions, not on continuous availability.

**Non-goals:**
- Not a battery technology.
- Not a power management driver.

**Example:** Energy is provided only when LPT reports a meaningful transition; otherwise, systems remain dormant.

## Relationship to LPT
**Definition:** Universe-E consumes LPT signals to determine meaningful transitions and apply energy policies.

**Non-goals:**
- Not a replacement for LPT.
- Not a modification of LPT semantics.

**Example:** LPT publishes a transition; Universe-E interprets it and decides whether to activate energy.
