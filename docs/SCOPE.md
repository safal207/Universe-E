# Universe-E Scope

## What Universe-E is

Universe-E is an Energy-as-a-Protocol specification that defines how energy activation is gated by meaningful transitions reported through LPT. It provides the conceptual rules for when systems should remain dormant and when they should activate energy.

Universe-E focuses on:
- Canonical terminology for transitions, significance, sleep, wake, and energy policy.
- The principle that energy activation is conditional on meaningful transitions.
- A clear boundary between semantic triggers (LPT) and energy response rules (Universe-E).

## What Universe-E is not

Universe-E is not:
- A battery chemistry or energy storage technology.
- A motor controller or power electronics design.
- A firmware implementation or device driver.
- An AI or ML model for prediction or inference.
- A complete hardware or simulation stack.
